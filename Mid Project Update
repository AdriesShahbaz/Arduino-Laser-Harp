Things I Have Working and have completed:
  - Fully built the frame of the harp
  - Laser is implemented and attached to the frame
  - Stepper motor is implemented and attached to the frame
  - Created small circuit board for stepper motor that has six sip sockets to allow easy plug in for the stepper motor
  - Working test code which displays four distinct beams
  
 
Things I Need To Still Work On:
  - Designing circuit boards for the LDRs
  - Attaching the LDRs to the frame
  - Create working code for the LDRs
  - Decide what method of sound I want (Piezo, MIDI, Speaker)
  
  
Issues And How I Solved Them:
  - The wires comming out of the 6 pin stepper motor were falling out so I designed a board with sip sockets for easy plug in
  - The stepper motor circuit was not working so I checked all the connections and solders and sure enough the ground solder was not connected
  - I forgot to implement a central ground and power source so I am using a mini breadboard to send all of my ground and power connections through before they reach the Arduino


Issues I Still Have Not Solved:
  - How to position all of my components (Arduino, Breadboard, Circuit Board) so that they are neat, not in the way, and the wires don't have the chance to pop out
  - How to handle the wires coming from the LDR boards (Run them down the side of the frame? Send them under the frame?)
  
Issues That Will Have To Persist:
  - Since the mirror is attached to the stepper motor and the stepper is moving very quickly, the mirror vibrates which doesn't allow me to get 4 perfect dots in the exact same spots
  - Since the mirror is slightly weighted on one side, the motor can only start in certain positions which makes it very difficult to use the top of the frame
  
Next Steps:
  - Solve the issues I still have not solved
  - Finish the things I need to still work on
  - Try to learn half stepping and micro stepping to potentially allow for more than 4 beams (Just learned about it today!)
  - Record a video of a working laser harp that allows the user to play a note when their hand is over a beam
